/**
 * A {@code BoundedExecutor} enforced a limit on the maximum number of tasks that can be
 * {@link Executor#execute(Runnable) executed} concurrently by another {@code Executor}. Once the maximum number of
 * tasks are executing attempts to execute another task will block until a previous task completes.
 * <p>
 * Users can use this class to control the concurrency in different sections of their code to avoid overloading a shared
 * global executor.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Using a {@code BoundedExecutor} does not guarantee the maximum number of threads generated by the
 * underlying executor, as this class has no control over the behavior or implementation of the supplied
 * {@code Executor} class. Restricting task submissions alone does not directly affect the number of threads that the
 * underlying executor may create.
 * <p>
 * Consider an executor with an unrestricted thread pool. Let's also assume that this executor has been optimized to
 * initiate task execution immediately upon arrival. In this scenario, it's possible that a new thread is generated, at
 * some point between the completion of a preceding task and the start of the execution of an incoming task. For example
 * if the thread executing a previous task must finish some cleanup operations after the task completes. In practical
 * terms, a {@code BoundedExecutor} does significantly impact the total number of active threads in an executor.
